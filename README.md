# Payment-Transfer-API-Server

This was a pair programming project in which we created a RESTful API server for a P2P application. MVC, DAOs, and a database were used for features such as creating an account, looking up users, transferring money, getting history, and accepting/declining requests.

- this repo only includes code we created and left out starter code
